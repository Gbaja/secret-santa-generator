## Thoughts

The main thing I was hoping to get out of this project was to understand the relations between front end, backend and how to use database to save and retrieve data. It was a good insight into how it all fits together. At first, I was confused about making an XMLHttRequest to get or post data to be used in the back end. This is because a url to me had always been a website one but by making this web app, I was able to familiarise myself with the concept. 
I have also been able to improve my ability to write SQL statements to make queries to add or get data from database. I really enjoyed working with database and hope to learn more about it, SQL to be more specific.  Learning about things like the content editable attribute in html was interesting.
